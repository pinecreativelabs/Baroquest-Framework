# Baroquest-Framework
A fancypants framework for the Baroquest web design style. Inspired by Baroque art and architecture, BF is the fancypants "sister framework" to Brutalist Framework. 

BF is an HTML template package that is comprised of CSS and javascript utility classes that can help with rapid prototyping of elegant and fancy-themed web or application designs.

### Fancy Features
* 30 custom fonts
* 23 color palettes
* 3 grid methods
* 10 CSS mask shapes
* 50 seamless wallpaper backgrounds
* 40 seamless pattern backgrounds
* 30 ornamental accents
* 7 pure CSS lace accent patterns
* 14 frames
* 12 seal styles
* 12 scroll-triggered effects
* 10 entrance animations

## Components
There are six components that comprise the core:
* __Palette__: color scheme library using CSS variables
* __Typography__: general typography utility classes library
* __LTC Grid__: grid system using CSS grid and Flexbox
* __Masquerade__: mask shapes and mix-blends for fancy facades
* __Ornaments__: decorative wallpapers, patterns, and accent elements
* __Movements__: scroll-triggered motions and other animations

The package includes full documentation and examples.

__NOTE:__ Some components make use of CSS masking, which include PNG images as the source. If working offline (on a local machine), these mask images won't render, due to being restricted to CORS policy (which is a security measure for modern browsers to not allow any webpage to access your filesystem). A solution for this is to try working within localhost. 

### BONUS TEMPLATES
There are three bonus templates included as examples of substyles of Baroquest design: 
* gothic-grotesque.html
* organic-nature.html
* victorian-vintage.html
